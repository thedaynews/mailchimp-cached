MailChimpCached
===============

This is just a caching version of Drew McLellanâ€™s excellent and tiny [MailChimp API wrapper](https://github.com/drewm/mailchimp-api). Use it in exactly the same way, just be aware that it caches.

Feel free to change `cache_dir` to something other than `/tmp` and tweak `method_lifetimes` to suit your needs.
